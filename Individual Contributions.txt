Cameron Brown

"I wrote the book class and all associated functions in the library class.
Specifically, in the library class, the functions that read in and store the data
in the book class from the database. I also started the base library class, and
Chris finished it. I wrote as many test cases as I could think of for the book
class to make sure that it runs smoothly in the program. That is basically what I
did on this project."


Chris Mansfield

Chris wrote the date class, the patron class, the main class, ~90% of the library class.
Chris was incredibly helpful during this project. He came up with ideas for making the program
faster by utilizing external libraries. Chris also helped with extensive QA as we crunched
to get everything completed and turned in. Chris did the majority of the heavy coding and was
key to our team's success.


Jon "Matt" Dale

Jon performed QA for the project. He wrote the test cases. His tests were performed manually
and through unit tests.

I was the project manager. I was very involved creating all of our documents
(glacier, wbs, project plan, CRC cards, etc.) I did not do any developing for this
project. Our team mainly stayed within their role responsibilities. Once I
finished all of our documents, I was more hands off for the project. In
retrospect, I should have organized more meetings for the team. These meetings
were extremely beneficial, and we waited too long before we started having them.

At the end of the project, I was also responsible for the user instructions, the
example files, compiling team member's contributions, additional project files and 
maintaining the project plan.
